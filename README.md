# Rosalind Problems 

My solutions to [Rosalind problems](http://rosalind.info/) in JavaScript (Node.js). 

## Why JavaScript?

Because Python is so 1999. And I wanted to learn more about "vanilla" JavaScript and the Node.js ecosystem.

## Modules used

* [node-bignum](https://github.com/justmoon/node-bignum) for those extra large numbers.
* [node-clone](https://github.com/pvorb/node-clone) for (deep) cloning of object.
* [node-graphviz](https://github.com/glejeune/node-graphviz) for sexy graphs.
