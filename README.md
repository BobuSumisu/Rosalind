# Rosalind Problems 

My solutions to [Rosalind problems](http://rosalind.info/) in JavaScript (Node.js). 

## Why JavaScript?

Because Python is so 1999. And I wanted to learn more about "vanilla" JavaScript and the Node.js ecosystem.

## Why not JavaScript?

I have yet to stumble upon any real problems with language itself. Scripts run fast and everyone is happy.

One thing to note is that the JavaScript `Number` type represent numbers as doubleprecision 64-bit values. The largest exact integer value is therefore `2^53`. 
I have used the [Bignum](https://github.com/justmoon/node-bignum) Node.js module in cases where larger integers were needed.
