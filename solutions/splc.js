/**
 * Rosalind Problem - RNA Splicing
 * by Ã˜yvind Ingvaldsen <oyvind.ingvaldsen@gmail.com>

 * http://rosalind.info/problems/splc/
 *
 * Problem:
 *  Given - A DNA string s (of length at most 1 kbp) and a collection of substrings of s action as introns. All strings are given in FASTA format.
 *  Return - A protein string resulting from transcribing and translating the exons of s. (Note: Only one solution will exist for the dataset provided.)
 *
 * Terms:
 *  RNA polymerase (RNAP) - An enzyme transcribing a double-stranded molecule of DNA in the nucleus into a strand of RNA.
 *  Precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) - The raw result of DNA transcription, which is then spliced to form a mature strand of mRNA for the purpose of protein translation.
 *  Template strand - The strand of a DNA molecule that is used as a template for DNA replication or RNA transcription.
 *  Coding strand - The strand of a double-stranded DNA molecule that is copied of transcribed into RNA.
 *  Intron - A segment of a gene not used for translation into protein.
 *  Exon - A contiguous segment of RNA converted into mRNA for protein translation.
 *  Splicing - The process by which the coding region of a gene is excised into an mRNA for protein translation.
 *  Spliceosome - A macromolecule of RNA and proteins that facilitates RNA splicing.
 *  Coding region - The collection of a gene's exons.
