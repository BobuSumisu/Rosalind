 * Rosalind Problem - Mendel's First Law

 * http://rosalind.info/problems/iprb/
 *
 * Problem:
 *  Given - Three positive integers k, m, and n, representing a population containing k + m + n organisms: k invidiuals are homozyogous dominant for a factor, m are heterozygous, and n are homozygous recessive.
 *  Return - The probability that two randomly selected mating organisms will produce an individual possessing a dominant allele (and thus displaying the dominant phenotype). Assume that any two organisms can mate.
 *
 * Terms:
 *  Blending inheritance - The faulty hereditary theory that stated an individual would exhibit a blend of its parents' traits.
 *  Factors - The Mendelian unit of heredity.
 *  Alleles - One of two possible form of a Mendelian factor (i.e., gene).
 *  First Law (Mendel) - Mendel's maxim that every gene has two alleles, one of which derives from each parent.
 *  Homozygous - Having two copies of the same allele for a Mendelian factor.
 *  Heterozygous - Having different alleles for a Mendelian factor.
 *  Dominant (allele) - The allele for a Mendelian factor that supercedes the recessive allele and determines the orgnaism's phenotype.
 *  Recessive (allele) - The allele for a Mendelian trait that is superceded by the dominant allele when determining the organism's phenotype.
 *  Genotype - An organism's precise genetic makeup.
 *  Phenotype - The physical manifestation of an organism's genetic makeup.
 *  Punnett square - A square representing the different posibilities for alleles of offspring given the alleles of both parents.
 *  Random variable - A variable that can take different values based on a randomized process.
 *  Outcomes - A possible value taken by a random variable.
 *  Event - A collection of outcomes of a random variable.
