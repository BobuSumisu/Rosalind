 * Rosalind Problem - Overlap Graphs
 * by Ã˜yvind Ingvaldsen <oyvind.ingvaldsen@gmail.com>

 * http://rosalind.info/problems/grph/
 *
 * Problem:
 *  Given - A collection of DNA strings in FASTA format having total length at most 10 kbp.
 *  Return - The adjacency list corresponding to O3. You may return edges in any order.
 *
 * Terms:
 *  Graph - A network containing a collection of nodes, pairs of which are joined by edges.
 *  Node - A point forming the hubs the network represented by a graph.
 *  Edge - A segment or curve connection two nodes in a graph.
 *  Incident - An edge is incident to a node if it connects it to another node.
 *  Adjacent - Nodes in a graph that are connected by an edge.
 *  Degree - The number of edjes incident to a node.
 *  Walk - An ordered collection of adjacent edges in a graph.
 *  Path - A collection of nodes and edges in which each node is connected to the next via an edge.
 *  Path length - The length of a path is its number of edges.
 *  Cycle - A path in a graph that begins and ends with the same node.
 *  Distance - The minimum weight (or length) of any path connecting two nodes.
 *  Adjacency list - A list containing the edges of a graph.
 *  Directed graph (digraph) - A graph whose edges are oriented as arrows.
 *  Directed edge - The oriented edge of a directed graph.
 *  Tail - The starting node of a directed edge.
 *  Head - The ending node of a directed edge.
 *  Directed loop - A directed edge (v, v).
 *  Overlap graph - A directed graph representing overlap relationships in a collection of strings.
 *  Suffix - A substring of a given string that includes its final symbol.
 *  Prefix - A substring of a given string that includes its first symbol.
